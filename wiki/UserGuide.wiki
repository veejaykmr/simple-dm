=Module metadata generation=
The SDM distribution contains a script able to extract module metadata from a local maven repository.

Collected metadata are packaged in the org.sdm.maven:metadata jar to be available to the SDM runtime. This is the way SDM Module manager gets aware of module metadata at runtime and can determine to which module a particular package or class belongs

When developing with SDM you need to keep this jar in sync with your maven local repository.
